# spoonacular
The "Spoonacular" project is a single-page web application meticulously crafted with the latest React framework, React Router for seamless navigation, and Tailwind CSS for streamlined styling. My application integrates the Edamam API to provide users with an extensive collection of food recipes, enhancing their culinary adventures. User feedback is collected and securely stored in a Supabase database, ensuring data integrity and accessibility. Additionally, I've prioritized security by managing sensitive credentials, such as API keys, within a .env file. This combination of technology and best practices results in a responsive, visually appealing, and user-friendly platform where users can explore and discover a wide range of delectable recipes.
